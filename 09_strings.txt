""" 
The startswith method is used to find out whether the string starts with the given string.
The in operator is used to check if a given string is a part of the string.

The find method is used to locate the position of the given substring within the string. find returns -1 if it is unsucessful in the finding the substring. The str class also has a neat method to join the items of the sequence with the string acting as a delimiter between each item of the sequence and returns a bigger string generated from this.
